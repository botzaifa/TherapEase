Mental health is a critical aspect of well-being, and yet stigma often prevents individuals from seeking help. TherapEase aims to break down these barriers by providing users with a user-friendly mobile application that offers:

- **Mental Health Screening Tools:** Users can assess their mental health status using validated screening tools, with real-time scoring and interpretation.

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Based on screening results, users receive personalized recommendations for self-help resources, coping strategies, and access to professional support.

- **Crisis Intervention:** In times of crisis, the app provides immediate support and emergency contact information.

- **Resource Library:** A comprehensive repository of mental health resources, including articles, videos, self-help guides, and local support services.

- **Progress Tracking:** Users can monitor their mental health progress over time through visualizations.
